fadein's screenkey
==================

Fork of https://github.com/seletskiy/screenkey
which is a fork of http://launchpad.net/screenkey


## What I've changed:

*	OSD visibility is controled by a USB Footpedal
	*	https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-foot-switch/overview
	*	When footpedal is pressed a PrintScreen (XK_Print) keypress is sent,
		and another PrintScreen is sent when the footpedal is released.
	*	As this program is already watching for keypresses, and inasmuch as
		PrintScreen doesn't need to show up on the display, it serves as a
		simple toggle between modes.
*	Space key changed to `␣` (The notes say it should already have been so)
*	Configurable timeout of OSD window

What's up?
==========

I've made significant changes, including:

* new command line flags:
  * `-fg` to set font color;
  * `-bg` to set background color;
  * `--no-sudo` do not perform check on launched sudo (it's currently VERY slow,
    because of this check will launch subprocess on EVERY key typed);
  * `-n, --no-hide` do not hide window after timeout, hide only text (make it
    usable with tile managers, for example, with i3, which can not have
    unfocusable windows);
* instead of removing text on `backspace` symbol `⌫` will be added; it was
  broken anyway, so it will happily erase `Ctrl+...` and other text;
* space is changed to visible character: `␣`;
* supported second keyboard layout, so not only ASCII letters can be recorded;
* way of detecting modifiers was changed and now based on pure event state
  field; it's more robust and precise, so, for example, if you remap arrow
  keys into Mod+\[HJKL\] (as I do) you get correct output (arrows, not Mod+arrows
  or something);
* `Shift+` is now not printed for characters that have two distinct states
  with and without Shift; it means, that when you type `Shift+q` you will see
  `Q`. However, if you type `Shift+Left`, you will see `Shift+←`;
* added another position modifier, and now window can be dragged around to
  choose optimal position and size; it will remembered and will not change
  after window hide/show cycle;
* font size is now binded to window height, so if you resize window you will
  get different font size;
* spacing between several keys are tweaked, so they will not nestle to each
  other, like this: `Ctrl+vhello`; instead, you will see: `Ctrl+v hello`.
